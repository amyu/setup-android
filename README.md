# setup-android

This action provides the following functionality for GitHub Actions users:

- Optionally downloading and caching distribution of the requested sdk version or build tools version or ndk,cmake version, and adding it to the PATH
- Runs on Mac, Linux and Windows powered by SelfHostedRunner

# Motivation

This Action is provided for SelfHostedRunner.  
GithubHostedRunner does not need this Action as it already has the SDK set up.
